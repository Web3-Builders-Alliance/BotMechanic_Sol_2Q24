### Github Link

### Brief Project Description

Automate and optimize liquidity provisioning for Concentrated Liquidity Pools on AMMs and DEXes.

### The reason I am building/choosing this project is...

The primary motivation for this project is to address a personal challenge I face with manual liquidity management. I believe this solution will not only streamline my efforts but also benefit others who encounter similar difficulties.

Currently, I provide liquidity on Orca (Whirlpools) manually, which is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to develop a system that can filter through various pools, select the optimal ones, and establish automated strategies for entering and exiting concentrated liquidity pools.

Initially, the focus will be on automating liquidity provisioning for AMMs like Orca, with potential expansion to other platforms like Raydium.

### Go-To-Market Strategy

My go-to-market strategy includes:

- Conducting in-depth research on models and algorithms that optimize liquidity provisioning.
- Utilizing existing market data to backtest and validate the selected strategies.
- Implementing and deploying the strategy with a small capital allocation for incremental testing and validation.

### Tech: The technologies I will use to build are

The project will leverage the Solana blockchain and its suite of technologies for developing smart contracts. Specifically, it will utilize the Orca AMM's SDK for interaction with its smart contracts.

A crucial second phase will involve integrating Machine Learning and AI to enhance decision-making processes.

### Method: Programming Language for SC / Testing

Smart contracts will be developed using Rust and the Anchor framework. Testing will predominantly be conducted using TypeScript and Mocha.

### Frontend Plans

Currently, the frontend plan is limited to developing CLI tools for interacting with the system.
